# DataMover-1.1
A WinForm Programm I wrote to transfer files from my one folder to another and back. You can creater new directories based on the date and the information will be stored in an txt.file to autofill on next use.

Data Mover ReadMe
DataMover is my first WinForm Programm.
DataMover is successor of my Handycleaner Console Programm. The main difference is that the DataMover has a user WinForm user interface and allows some freedom in the creation of directories and transfers.
I use it to transfer dated screenshot files from my phone to my desktop pc. Then I check them and decide which one I wanna have back on my phone. Then I transfer them back with DataMover. 

- DataMover can be used to automatically create dated folders and sub folders.
- You can transfer data from one folder to another and back. 
- DataMover saves the choices from the current creation and transfer in a txt. 
- DataMover autofills text fields on start up after a working folder with a txt save file is chosen. The information will be automatically adjusted for new date.

If the link to the .exe doesn't work you can find the .exe file at DataMover 1.1\DataMover\obj\Debug\DataMover.exe
